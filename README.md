# DisMutationTool

## Overview

This tool is designed for mutation testing of distributed systems, aiming to ensure robustness and fault tolerance by introducing controlled mutations and observing the system's ability to handle them. This testing approach helps developers identify weaknesses in fault handling and recovery processes.

## Features

- **Automated Mutation Injection:** Automatically introduces faults into the system to test the effectiveness of fault detection and recovery mechanisms.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Tracks the system's response to mutations in real time, providing immediate feedback and mutation score calculation.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generates comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Maven/Ant/Gradle, depends on target system requirements
- Existing distributed system code and test suite for testing
